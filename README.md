## What's LangCursor?

It's a handy tool for **developers who frequently work with non-English languages**.

It enhances coding accuracy by reducing language-based typing errors in a multilingual coding environment.

It supports for Windows and macOS environments.

### Key Feature: Cursor Color Change for Non-English Languages
- **Automatic Cursor Color Change**
  - The primary function of LangCursor is to help you avoid typos. It does this by automatically changing the color of your cursor when you're typing in a non-English language.
- **Compatibility with Vim emulation plugin**
  - LangCursor also integrates seamlessly with the 'Insert Mode' cursor, a feature commonly used in conjunction with Vim emulation plugins.<!-- Plugin description end -->
